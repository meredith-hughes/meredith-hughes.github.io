									<p>
Teaching people about space is one of my favorite parts of being an astronomer.  I teach several classes per year at Wesleyan University; please email me if you’re a faculty member interested in sharing materials.  I've also taught and tutored physics and astronomy at the high school through graduate levels (including at the <a href="https://ssp.org/home/">Summer Science Program</a>, an organization dear to my heart).  I try to keep my skills sharp with formal instruction in pedagogy and education research through coursework and workshops.  I strongly recommend the <a href="https://www.aapt.org/Conferences/newfaculty/nfw.cfm">AAPT Physics & Astronomy Faculty Teaching Institute</a> and the <a href="https://lists.aas.org/AASEducation/subscribe/">AAS Education Newsletter</a>.

				<h2 class="major"> Science Education, Outreach, and Involvement </h2>

				<p>I love the challenge and fun of communicating science to non-scientists. If you’re on campus, I encourage you to stop by the Van Vleck Observatory for one of our public nights, which are free and open to everyone.  The revamp of public nights into Space Nights and Kids’ Nights was funded by a series of my NSF grants. I also work EPO into the astronomy curriculum at Wesleyan by teaching ASTR430: Pedagogy Seminar, a community engaged learning course that trains students to give presentations to the public, including bringing our digital planetarium to local schools and community organizations.  I'm also interested in issues of diversity and equality in science, particularly those that are gender-related.  
</p>
<p>
Here are some educational initiatives I've been involved with:

				<h2 class="major">AAS Committee Work</h2>
				<p>
				One of my professional goals is to work to make our field a more equitable and inclusive environment.  To that end, I have served on two AAS committees: the <a href="https://aas.org/comms/cswa">Committee on the Status of Women in Astronomy (CSWA)</a> and the <a href="https://aas.org/comms/ethics">AAS Code of Ethics Committee (CoEC)</a>.  
				</p>
				<p>
				I was an inaugural member and served one term as chair and another as interim chair of the CoEC, which is charged with educating the community about ethical conduct and investigating complaints related to potential breaches of the AAS Code of Ethics.  I worked with Publication Committee members to write a AAS <a href="https://aas.org/posts/news/2023/06/citation-ethics-publishing">newsletter article on citation ethics in publishing</a>. 
				</p>
				<p>
				I also served a term on the CSWA, acting as the liaison between CSWA and the Working Group on LGBTIQA Equality (now SGMA).  I led an update to the 20-year-old demographics survey conducted by CSWA and STScI, and I presented the results in the <a href="https://womeninastronomy.blogspot.com/2014/03/the-2013-cswa-demographics-survey.html">CSWA's STATUS magazine</a> and at a town hall at the 2014 AAS meeting.
